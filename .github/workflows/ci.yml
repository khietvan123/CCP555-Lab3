        # There are two ways we could do this:
        #
        # 1. Call `npm ci` followed by `npm test` like so (NOTE: the use of | and -):
        # run: |
        # - npm install
        # - npm test
        #
        # 2. Use `install-ci-test` to do it in a single command, see http://localhost:8080
        # run: npm install-ci-test
        run: npm install-ci-test
